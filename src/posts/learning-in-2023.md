Like many others I thought it would be nice to highlight a few topics that I am currently focusing on learning right now.

### Tailwind CSS

In my career I've worked with many styling solutions: Plain CSS, SCSS (Sass), Bootstrap, CSS-in-JS, Emotion, styled components, and others. The amount of solutions out there are endless, each with their own pros and cons.

Recently I've come across [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). While it's been around for awhile it's been picking up steam as of recent. Compared to all the other styling solutions it has promise: It does away with the need to implement "Best Practices" like B-E-M and Semantic CSS.

The maintainers of Tailwind are right: ["Best Practices" are actually hard](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/), if not impossible to maintain as a system gets larger. At one workplace I used to be at implementing SCSS, looking back, we would confuse the scheming and naming, resulting in really confusing CSS and even worse maintainability. Tailwind does away with this issue.

I'll probably end up implementing Tailwind on this website if it goes well enough.

### A Backend Language

I'm currently learning Rust. It's widely loved and is pretty similar to Javascript in a number of ways (but also very different!). It has the performance of other backend languages without their pitfalls (C++ and memory allocation for instance) without the as-high learning curve.

There's also a few open source projects I'd like to contribute to that all are developed in Rust. I hope by the year's end that I'll have been able to make solid contributions to said projects.

### AWS, Cloud, Microservices

It's embarassing to tell people that I've never worked with AWS in any manner. In the workplaces that have used AWS in my career, it's usually been out of the hands of the developers. I've used plenty of other cloud services such as Render, Heroku, Netlify and Vercel. However in the past I've shied away from AWS due to its cost and lack of generous free-tier. But I've decided since I'm paying for other things that AWS should be given a go.

That being said there are an endless amount of services inside AWS, but I'm primarily focusing on Lambdas as a way to learn about microservice architecture.

Regarding Lambdas and Microservice Architectures: It's true that Microservices have [recently](https://www.primevideotech.com/video-streaming/scaling-up-the-prime-video-audio-video-monitoring-service-and-reducing-costs-by-90) had a bit of controversy lately but the key is learning about other types of software architectures. Most of my career has revolved around developing monoliths. Learning about microservices is yet another way of understanding how to deliver better.

### Courses

Mostly taking a year-long option for [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com). While I feel like my Frontend fundementals are already quite solid, there's never harm in revisiting topics: Not only is there an endless amount of topics to cover, but refreshers can reveal holes in knowledge.

It's true there are free alternatives and platforms, but there's also value in how Frontend Masters has a roadmap and consolidates it in a guided manner that other platforms I've used have not done as well.

### Reading

Lastly there are books that I've picked up to supplement my learning. I'm currently reading A [Philosophy of Software Design](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-2nd/dp/173210221X), [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/), and [System Design Interview](https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF/).

Most of my reading is dedicated to architecturing. In the past I haven't really given much part to architecting or designing software, but coding is really only half the job of a good developer. The other half is designing software well. Good design [increases maintainability, performance and understanding](https://medium.com/swlh/importance-of-software-design-7ffea48ede17).

### Conclusion

There's still an endless amount of things to be learned and I'm always looking for the latest things out there. However, this roadmap is where I feel like I can get the most value for myself as of now. I hope to revisit this by the year's end and get my thoughts on all of these.
